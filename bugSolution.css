To solve these problems, carefully use parentheses to control the order of operations within the `calc()` function and consistently use units. For the example `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10%);`, to ensure the `20px` is subtracted from `50%` before the `10%` is added use `width: calc((50% - 20px) + 10%);` or `width: calc(50% + 10% - 20px);` depending on the desired result.  If using percentages and pixels together, ensure that each part is explicitly in the correct units.
