The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10%);` might not behave as you intend because the order of operations might not be what you expect. Parentheses can help enforce a specific order but forgetting them can lead to errors. Another case is using different units inconsistently within a `calc()` expression; you should make sure units are compatible.
